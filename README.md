# awesome-saas-services

A curated of the best services for developers to build a modern application.

# Vision

I don't believe in the "no-backend" or "generic backend" services like Firebase, Kinvey and Parse. Those type of solutions lock you in and aren't flexible to changing demands as your product grows.

This list assumes that you have control over your codebase and leverage services where it makes sense.

# The list
